The entry into force of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1968, banning nuclear arming of all states of the world, with the exception of the five existing nuclear powers, was another key moment in the efforts to end the nuclear arms race and, indirectly, nuclear weapons testing (van der Meer 2011 ). Although the provisions of the treaty were to be implemented with the help of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (Weitz 2011 ), geopolitical experiences of the last four decades have shown that, outside the scope of the NPT, a different category of nuclear states had emerged, including India, South Africa, Pakistan, North Korea, and apparently Israel (unconfirmed nuclear status) (McDonnell 2013 ), with some of these countries conducting nuclear weapons tests of their own. In 1996, a new phase in stopping all types of nuclear tests began, with the United Nations adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT 1996 ).",,

The second category, the nuclear-armed states, is represented by India, South Africa, Pakistan, North Korea, and most likely Israel—the nuclear states armed between 1968 and 2006—currently considered outside the NPT (McDonnell 2013 ). The exception is South Africa, the country that disarmed itself after the year 1990 in the context of internal political changes (Magnarella 2008 ). The reasons which led to the proliferation of nuclear weapons are mainly of geopolitical nature: international prestige, geostrategic regional consolidation, and regional/global power status (van der Meer 2011 ). Therefore, testing nuclear weapons was one of the main ways of asserting nuclear power status, as well as the place held by these states in the hierarchy of nuclear geopolitics.",,

The severe environmental damage caused by these nuclear tests, the most powerful ever to be conducted in the atmosphere, as well as the general context of global nuclear weapons tests, have created the premises of the first instance of large-scale international cooperation to eliminate nuclear weapons testing. Thus, 1963 marked a milestone with the entry into force of the Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT), a treaty stipulating a ban on nuclear weapons tests in all global environments, except for the underground (Rubinson 2011 ). Although it was not signed by two key states—France and China (Mastny 2008 ), as these countries continued their nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere—the treaty had a genuine impact in limiting radioactive isotopes in the atmosphere in the two hemispheres from 1963 on (Levin et al. 1994 ; Manning and Melhuish 1994 ).",,

The present study is based on an analysis of the environmental impacts generated by nuclear weapons tests, mainly discussing the matter of atmospheric and oceanic environmental contamination both in global and regional contexts, and punctual matters concerning human exposure to radioactive pollution.

The entry into force of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1968, banning nuclear arming of all states of the world, with the exception of the five existing nuclear powers, was another key moment in the efforts to end the nuclear arms race and, indirectly, nuclear weapons testing (van der Meer 2011 ). Although the provisions of the treaty were to be implemented with the help of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (Weitz 2011 ), geopolitical experiences of the last four decades have shown that, outside the scope of the NPT, a different category of nuclear states had emerged, including India, South Africa, Pakistan, North Korea, and apparently Israel (unconfirmed nuclear status) (McDonnell 2013 ), with some of these countries conducting nuclear weapons tests of their own. In 1996, a new phase in stopping all types of nuclear tests began, with the United Nations adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT 1996 ).",0.7311637818813324,1.0

The severe environmental damage caused by these nuclear tests, the most powerful ever to be conducted in the atmosphere, as well as the general context of global nuclear weapons tests, have created the premises of the first instance of large-scale international cooperation to eliminate nuclear weapons testing. Thus, 1963 marked a milestone with the entry into force of the Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT), a treaty stipulating a ban on nuclear weapons tests in all global environments, except for the underground (Rubinson 2011 ). Although it was not signed by two key states—France and China (Mastny 2008 ), as these countries continued their nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere—the treaty had a genuine impact in limiting radioactive isotopes in the atmosphere in the two hemispheres from 1963 on (Levin et al. 1994 ; Manning and Melhuish 1994 ).",0.5369257688522339,0.6666666666666666

However, the large number of nuclear weapons tests carried out in the atmosphere and underground during 1945–2013 (the last nuclear test was performed by North Korea) was responsible for the current environmental contamination with radioactive waste which resulted in ecologically and socially destroyed sites, due to high levels of radioactivity. The present study is based on an analysis of the environmental impacts generated by nuclear weapons tests, mainly discussing the matter of atmospheric and oceanic environmental contamination both in global and regional contexts, and punctual matters concerning human exposure to radioactive pollution. Geopolitical Context and Particularities of Nuclear Weapons Tests The alarming nuclear arms race that the five nuclear powers launched in the second half of the twentieth century was the result of the special status they enjoyed during the international nuclear disarmament policies, of which the most representative example is the NPT (Grotto 2010 ; Prăvălie 2012 ).",0.518191111087799,0.6666666666666666

Ian Redmond Many of the gorillas killed by poachers were buried on the grounds of Fossey's camp (Credit: Ian Redmond) Vedder, who arrived only two months after Digit was killed, says that Fossey did not believe any Rwandan would be sincere or smart enough to help. ""She shut them out entirely. She was extremely dismissive of them,"" Vedder says. Fossey did not seem to realise that, to save the gorillas, she would need all the help she could get, including from the authorities she despised. She refused to work with those proposing new methods of conservation, arguing that any efforts that did not focus on poaching were wasted. She was known to call it ""comic book conservation"".

Ian Redmond Fossey's life was undoubtedly controversial, but her legacy can still be seen in the rebounding fortunes of mountain gorillas today (Credit: Ian Redmond) The 1990s saw the horrors of the Rwandan genocide, but throughout this dreadful period the gorillas' numbers stayed relatively stable. ""I think that's part of Dian's legacy, too,"" says Stewart. ""I think she kept it going in the forest, if it [the research centre] hadn't been there so long, I think it's possible that the Mountain Gorilla Project wouldn't have started."" Even today, mountain gorillas are believed to be one of the few apes whose numbers are not in decline. They remain endangered but less than a decade ago they were classified "" critically endangered "". An annual naming ceremony of baby gorillas in Rwanda recently celebrated its 20th anniversary and since 2005 over 400 baby gorillas have been celebrated at the ceremony.

Her early work was painstaking. To get close to the gorillas, she started imitating their behaviour. As she explained to the BBC in 1984 : ""I'm an inhibited persona and I felt that the gorillas were somewhat inhibited as well, so I imitated their natural, normal behaviour like feeding, munching on celery stalks or scratching myself."" She would also beat her chest with her fists and copy their belch-like calls. Fossey's patience and quiet demeanour paid off. She gained the gorillas' trust and could observe them undisturbed. She soon started to see which gorillas belonged to which family, and learnt the key role played by the dominant ""silverback"" male in each family. This method of gaining their trust is called habituation. It was Fossey's great gift to the world, says gorilla conservationist Ian Redmond, who worked closely with her for over three years. Eventually it led to human-gorilla friendships. ""I mean that seriously,"" says Redmond. ""Gorillas are so like us and they can see they're like us.",0.5376545488834381,0.6666666666666666

One of those killed was Uncle Bert, the group's dominant silverback. Gorilla families depend heavily on their leaders, so his death was devastating to Digit's family. ""Kweli died from bullet-wound complications combined, I think, with acute depression. He was buried between his mother and father, who lay next to Digit. All three adults, in effect, had died so that he might live,"" Fossey wrote. She blamed these killings on the local government. ""Dian felt it was because the authorities wanted a dramatic story for the world to respond to,"" says Redmond. The publicity around Digit's death may even have inspired others to get a quick buck from poaching, Fossey thought at the time.

In this respect, there are common traits with nuclear accidents like the one at Chernobyl, which involved the atmosphere-to-ground level transfer of radionuclide 90 Sr at a rate of about 96 % as wet deposition (WHO 2010 ). As in the case of radionuclide, 137 Cs, two of the most important environmental consequences of this radionuclide's transfer in the terrestrial environment are the soil deposition and soil-to-plant transfer, which were conditioned during nuclear testing from one region to another by climatic factors, soil physicochemical properties, and plant genetic peculiarities (Zhu and Shaw 2000 ).

Therefore, in terms of environmental effects, the marine environment has played an essential role in limiting these effects by means of its great assimilation capacity, although there are also some negative aspects concerning the radionuclide accumulation in the aquatic organisms. Otherwise, there would have been a major risk that the radionuclide 14 C be assimilated in enormous quantities in the biosphere (especially by forest ecosystems), and subsequently assimilated in the food chain, too (including in the human body).

Spatial Variability of Nuclear Tests in the Global Context. Critical Issues of Contamination According to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), the United States has conducted the largest number of nuclear weapons tests, most of them conducted especially on the North American soil (Fig. 4 ). The Nevada desert is the major region where 44 % of all the nuclear tests worldwide were conducted. The environmental consequences are related to atmospheric contamination with radioactive isotopes (especially 14 C and 137 Cs) following the atmospheric nuclear tests conducted during 1951–1963. Other negative effects reported were related to atmospheric contamination with the radionuclides, 131 I and 133 I, which were later transferred to the biosphere mainly through rainfalls (Simon et al. 2006 ).",0.7730556786060333,1.0

This approach estimates the relationships between a set of input variables and several output variables by fitting a multidimensional linear model. It is particularly useful in scenarios where outputs are interdependent or share underlying patterns, such as predicting multiple economic indicators or reconstructing images, [ 91 ] which are inherently multi-dimensional.

Multivariate linear regression extends the concept of linear regression to handle multiple dependent variables simultaneously. This approach estimates the relationships between a set of input variables and several output variables by fitting a multidimensional linear model. It is particularly useful in scenarios where outputs are interdependent or share underlying patterns, such as predicting multiple economic indicators or reconstructing images, [ 91 ] which are inherently multi-dimensional.

In terms of energy released in nuclear explosions, expressed in megatonnes (Mt) of TNT equivalent, two different processes were involved, namely fission (of 235 U and 239 Pu isotopes in a chain reaction) and fusion (of the hydrogen isotopes, deuterium and tritium, in a thermonuclear process) (United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, UNSCEAR 1993 ). In terms of radioactivity, the fission process produces a whole range of radionuclides, while the fusion process generally only produces tritium ( 3 H). However, the fusion process can also generate other radioactive materials (responsible for large amounts of radioactive debris), especially because of the inherent fission process of certain stages of thermonuclear reactions. Between 1951 and 1992, nuclear tests totaled an explosive yield of approx. 530 Mt, of which 83 % (440 Mt) were due to the atmospheric nuclear tests carried out between 1951 and 1980, and 17 % (90 Mt) to the underground nuclear tests carried out between 1962 and 1992 (Fig. 1 e).",,
