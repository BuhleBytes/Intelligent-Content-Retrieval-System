This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for \"general intelligence\".

This process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points. Particularly beneficial in image and signal processing , k-means clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids, thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space.

[ 2 ] [ 41 ] Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases. The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the probably approximately correct learning model. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common.",

The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalisation error . For the best performance in the context of generalisation, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has underfitted the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalisation will be poorer. [ 42 ] In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time . There are two kinds of time complexity results: Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.",

Approaches [ edit ] In supervised learning , the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning , the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data. Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the \"signal\" or \"feedback\" available to the learning system: Supervised learning : The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a \"teacher\", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. Unsupervised learning : No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end ( feature learning ). Reinforcement learning : A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent).",

    "text": "'Her behaviour could be extreme': The woman who gave her life to save the gorillas 19 December 2025 Share Save Melissa Hogenboom Share Save Ian Redmond (Credit: Ian Redmond) Dian Fossey transformed our view of mountain gorillas while fighting tooth and nail to save them. But according to the people who knew her, she was also a flawed obsessive whose murder remains a mystery to this day. It is now 40 years since the mysterious murder of Dian Fossey, the primatologist who transformed the way we see gorillas. Before Fossey's work, gorillas had an appalling reputation as violent brutes that would kill a human on sight. Fossey demolished this myth. Living alongside a group of mountain gorillas in the forests of Rwanda, she showed that these huge apes are actually gentle giants, with individual personalities and rich social lives. In many ways they are like us. But the mountain gorillas were also in terminal decline, their habitats encroached on by farms and overrun by war and civil unrest. Fossey spent her last years embroiled in an increasingly savage battle to save them, until she was murdered in her cabin in 1985. Her murderer and the reason for her death remain a mystery.",

The 1988 film Gorillas in the Mist presented a fictionalised version of Fossey's story. We have attempted to tell it as it really happened by speaking in depth to three of Fossey's colleagues and friends, one of whom, Ian Redmond, provided nearly all the photos featured. Dian Fossey did not set out to become a primatologist. She simply loved African nature and was inspired to travel to the continent in 1963. During this trip she met the renowned palaeoanthropologist Louis Leakey. He was focused on studying the fossils of our ancestors, but had realised that to really understand how humans had evolved, we would also have to learn about our closest relatives: the apes. Leakey had already helped Jane Goodall set up long-term studies of chimpanzees. Now he wanted to start something similar for gorillas. At the time little was known about mountain gorillas, one of two subspecies of the eastern gorilla. In films they were depicted as violent brutes and tales from hunters suggested that if anyone got too close, they would charge to kill.",

Three years after their meeting, Leakey hired Fossey to study mountain gorillas in the Democratic Republic of Congo. But conflict in the country forced her to leave. So in September 1967, Fossey set up a small research outpost in neighbouring Rwanda: the Karisoke Research Center . This consisted of a few cabins high in the volcanic Virunga mountains. The area was and is home to the Virunga group of mountain gorillas. This is one of only two populations in the world, the other one being in Uganda. There were about 475 individuals in the early 1960s, but their numbers were dwindling due to poaching and habitat loss. In the early 1980s the population dropped to about 254 individuals .

To get close to the gorillas, she started imitating their behaviour. As she explained to the BBC in 1984 : \"I'm an inhibited persona and I felt that the gorillas were somewhat inhibited as well, so I imitated their natural, normal behaviour like feeding, munching on celery stalks or scratching myself.\" She would also beat her chest with her fists and copy their belch-like calls. Fossey's patience and quiet demeanour paid off. She gained the gorillas' trust and could observe them undisturbed. She soon started to see which gorillas belonged to which family, and learnt the key role played by the dominant \"silverback\" male in each family. This method of gaining their trust is called habituation. It was Fossey's great gift to the world, says gorilla conservationist Ian Redmond, who worked closely with her for over three years. Eventually it led to human-gorilla friendships. \"I mean that seriously,\" says Redmond. \"Gorillas are so like us and they can see they're like us.",

For the first time, gorillas were captured on film for people to watch in their own homes. Fossey also named the gorillas she studied and shared their characteristics, just as Jane Goodall had done with chimpanzees. \"That was greatly inspiring.

Fossey was murdered before she could learn that her work had paved the way for mountain gorillas to begin recovering. Her research laid the foundations for much of what has since been learned about gorillas, allowing the creation of a successful and well-managed conservation and ecotourism industry.",

Ian Redmond Fossey's life was undoubtedly controversial, but her legacy can still be seen in the rebounding fortunes of mountain gorillas today (Credit: Ian Redmond) The 1990s saw the horrors of the Rwandan genocide, but throughout this dreadful period the gorillas' numbers stayed relatively stable. \"I think that's part of Dian's legacy, too,\" says Stewart. \"I think she kept it going in the forest, if it [the research centre] hadn't been there so long, I think it's possible that the Mountain Gorilla Project wouldn't have started.\" Even today, mountain gorillas are believed to be one of the few apes whose numbers are not in decline. They remain endangered but less than a decade ago they were classified \" critically endangered \". An annual naming ceremony of baby gorillas in Rwanda recently celebrated its 20th anniversary and since 2005 over 400 baby gorillas have been celebrated at the ceremony. Today there are an estimated 1,063 mountain gorillas left in the wild, a steady rise since 2012, which put the total number at 880 .",

In addition, an attempt was made to trace the spatial delimitation of the most heavily contaminated sites worldwide, and to note the human exposure which has caused a significantly increased incidence of thyroidal cancer locally and regionally. The United States is one of the important examples of assessing the correlation between the increase in the thyroid cancer incidence rate and the continental-scale radioactive contamination with 131 I, a radioactive isotope which was released in large amounts during the nuclear tests carried out in the main test site, Nevada.

Initially, in the synergistic context of Cold War geopolitics and the lack of effective international disarmament policies, countries like the United States, the USSR, the United Kingdom, France, and China became nuclear powers during 1945–1964 (Katz 2008 ; Schenck and Youmans 2012 ). During this period, a large number of nuclear tests were conducted in all global environments (atmosphere, underground, and underwater). Between 1945 and 1963, the United States and the USSR conducted a large number of nuclear tests in the atmosphere, the most representative examples being the first nuclear explosions of the hydrogen bomb conducted in 1954 by the United States, in the Marshall Islands, on the Bikini atoll (the Castle Bravo test); and in 1961, by the USSR, in the Novaia Zemlia archipelago, north of the Ural mountains (the Tsar test) (Goodby 2005 ).",

The severe environmental damage caused by these nuclear tests, the most powerful ever to be conducted in the atmosphere, as well as the general context of global nuclear weapons tests, have created the premises of the first instance of large-scale international cooperation to eliminate nuclear weapons testing. Thus, 1963 marked a milestone with the entry into force of the Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT), a treaty stipulating a ban on nuclear weapons tests in all global environments, except for the underground (Rubinson 2011 ). Although it was not signed by two key states—France and China (Mastny 2008 ), as these countries continued their nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere—the treaty had a genuine impact in limiting radioactive isotopes in the atmosphere in the two hemispheres from 1963 on (Levin et al. 1994 ; Manning and Melhuish 1994 ).",

The entry into force of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1968, banning nuclear arming of all states of the world, with the exception of the five existing nuclear powers, was another key moment in the efforts to end the nuclear arms race and, indirectly, nuclear weapons testing (van der Meer 2011 ). Although the provisions of the treaty were to be implemented with the help of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (Weitz 2011 ), geopolitical experiences of the last four decades have shown that, outside the scope of the NPT, a different category of nuclear states had emerged, including India, South Africa, Pakistan, North Korea, and apparently Israel (unconfirmed nuclear status) (McDonnell 2013 ), with some of these countries conducting nuclear weapons tests of their own.

The second category, the nuclear-armed states, is represented by India, South Africa, Pakistan, North Korea, and most likely Israel—the nuclear states armed between 1968 and 2006—currently considered outside the NPT (McDonnell 2013 ). The exception is South Africa, the country that disarmed itself after the year 1990 in the context of internal political changes (Magnarella 2008 ). The reasons which led to the proliferation of nuclear weapons are mainly of geopolitical nature: international prestige, geostrategic regional consolidation, and regional/global power status (van der Meer 2011 ). Therefore, testing nuclear weapons was one of the main ways of asserting nuclear power status, as well as the place held by these states in the hierarchy of nuclear geopolitics.",

In terms of energy released in nuclear explosions, expressed in megatonnes (Mt) of TNT equivalent, two different processes were involved, namely fission (of 235 U and 239 Pu isotopes in a chain reaction) and fusion (of the hydrogen isotopes, deuterium and tritium, in a thermonuclear process) (United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, UNSCEAR 1993 ). In terms of radioactivity, the fission process produces a whole range of radionuclides, while the fusion process generally only produces tritium ( 3 H). However, the fusion process can also generate other radioactive materials (responsible for large amounts of radioactive debris), especially because of the inherent fission process of certain stages of thermonuclear reactions. Between 1951 and 1992, nuclear tests totaled an explosive yield of approx. 530 Mt, of which 83 % (440 Mt) were due to the atmospheric nuclear tests carried out between 1951 and 1980, and 17 % (90 Mt) to the underground nuclear tests carried out between 1962 and 1992 (Fig. 1 e).",

In this case, 137 Cs has the highest contribution to the truncated effective dose commitment (35 %), followed by radionuclide 90 Sr (8.1 %) (Fig. 2 ). This comparative situation is necessary because the 14 C radionuclide has a much greater half-life compared with most other radionuclides (it is estimated that approx. 70 % of the collective effective dose commitment will have been delivered in 10 000 years, for a projected future stabilized world population of 10 10 people) (UNSCEAR 2000b ).",

The radionuclide 14 C is created by nitrogen ( 14 N)—naturally present in the atmosphere—capturing the neutrons released in excess during nuclear tests. Once formed, it is rapidly oxidized to 14 CO and then to 14 CO 2 , and it is then transferred to the global carbon reservoirs (the atmosphere, the ocean, and the terrestrial biosphere), where it is very difficult to remove from, because of its extremely long half-life (5730 years) (Currie et al. 2011 ). In terms of the temporal evolution of mean annual 14 C concentration in the atmosphere, specialized measurements (Levin et al. 1994 ; Manning and Melhuish 1994 ) have shown that the values peaked in 1964, immediately after the entry into force of the LTBT (Fig. 3 a). This situation is valid especially in the northern hemisphere (according to the measurements taken at Vermunt Station, Austria), because in the case of the southern hemisphere, there is a gap of at least 1 year as far as the maximal recorded values are concerned (Wellington Station, New Zealand).",

Therefore, in the case of the northern hemisphere, a peak concentration of 835 ‰ can be noticed in 1964, which then dropped steadily to a value of 226 ‰ by 1983 (Fig. 3 a).

The transfer of the radionuclide 14 C to the marine environment was possible through the exchange of gases in the ocean–atmosphere interference space. One of the methods used in reconstructing its fluctuations in the ocean consists in measuring its concentration in aquatic organisms, reservoirs that store 14 C. One example is the Arctica islandica bivalves mollusk, which served in the reconstruction of fluctuations of the radionuclide 14 C in the marine environment in the temperate zone of the North Atlantic (Scourse et al. 2012 ).",

This means that an amplitude fluctuation of maximum–minimum values exists, which was significantly attenuated and also much delayed compared with the concentration values in the atmosphere (peaks during 1964–1965 followed by a constant decline up to the present time, compared with the values from the marine environment, peaking in 1974 followed by a steady decline up to the year of the latest available data, i.e., 1996) (Fig. 3 b).

Another site of major importance is Novaya Zemlya, where nearly 20 % of all the Soviet Union's nuclear testing was carried out (130 nuclear tests) (Fig. 5 ). As nearly 70 % of all tests were atmospheric, substantial amounts of nuclear debris reached the stratosphere (especially in 1961 and 1962), thus entering a global-scale dispersion process.

Nuclear tests with serious contamination effects were also conducted in Eastern Asia, Australia, and the North Pacific (Fig. 6 ). Lop Nur, in western China, stands out among the most heavily contaminated sites, where the 23 nuclear tests conducted during 1964–1980 have generated a number of radioactive isotopes that have contaminated the biggest part of the province of Xianjiang, including eastern Kazakhstan (Yamamoto et al. 2004 ).

France conducted 179 nuclear tests on the Moruroa atoll alone, 42 of them in the atmosphere and 137 in the underground, making this site the third in the world in terms of the most number of nuclear weapons tests, after the Nevada Test Site, and Semipalatinsk. In Fangataufa, the number of nuclear tests was much lower (14 tests: 4 in the atmosphere and 10 in underground), but the carrying out of the biggest French thermonuclear test in 1968 (the Canopus test) caused a serious radioactive contamination, especially in the marine environment.

In this instance, 80 % of the 131 I activity contained in the radioactive debris was estimated to be between 9.5 km and 13.7 km (where, due to higher wind speeds, the radioactive dust dispersion process was accelerated), 10 % was between 9.5 km and ground level, and the remaining 10 % was deposited as the local fallout (NCI 1997a ). Therefore, wind characteristics at different levels of the troposphere (the example of Figs. 7 a, b, c) and the dominant west–east wind shift have resulted in the rapid dispersion of 131 I radioactive dust over long distances and the contamination of vast territories, at least at a regional scale, during atmospheric nuclear tests.",

Apparent ascending patterns were also found in Nebraska, Colorado, and Minnesota. Therefore, it can be asserted that, while there is a certain connection between the average per capita cumulative thyroid dose values and the thyroidal cancer incidence rate increase in the analyzed states, it can only be attributed to 131 I to a certain extent. The significant rise of thyroidal incidents can also be closely related to the therapeutic radiation treatments or other risk factors (mostly connected to medical procedures) which have become increasingly perceivable over the last three decades not only in the United States, but also on a global scale (Chen et al.",

As a result, while it is cumbersome to correctly determine which risk factors were responsible for the thyroidal cancer incidence increase over the past decades, most studies have shown that therapeutic radiation treatments and environmental exposure to 131 I from atmospheric nuclear testing are the most important risk factors. In a global context, the Chernobyl accident may have been an additional important cause of thyroidal cancer incidence increase in the United States, over the recent decades. Also, with regard to population exposure to thyroidal cancer risks from 131 I, it is presently significantly lower, and only certain categories of people present a higher incidence risk.",

These categories depend mostly on variables such as their age at exposure (generally, children up to 10 years of age were the highest risk category during atmospheric nuclear tests), their location between 1951 and 1962, their main diet, their source of milk (as cow milk was the main contamination source), and the amount of milk consumed (Lyon et al. 2006 ). Therefore, the age at exposure is one of the most important variables, as people exposed to radioactive iodine as children may present a high thyroidal cancer risk even decades after the cessation of atmospheric nuclear testing.

Since approximately two thirds of the Globe's surface is covered by water, a significant share of these radionuclides has been transferred into the marine environment, as in the cases of radionuclides 137 Cs and 90 Sr, with negative consequences being primarily related to the bioaccumulation through food chain cycles.",

The indirect transfer of radionuclides into the geospheres and their accumulation in living cells, by way of the food chain, was yet another form of radioactive contamination of the marine and terrestrial ecosystems. One of the most representative examples is the isotope 14 C released into the atmosphere during nuclear tests, which is later integrated into the CO 2 , and then reaches the marine environment, by means of the ocean–atmosphere gas exchange, or the biosphere through the process of photosynthesis. In terms of human exposure, the increase in the thyroidal cancer incidence in many areas of the globe (strongly affected by the radioactive contamination with the 131 I radionuclide) is the one among the worst consequences of nuclear testing. This paper's case study, the United States, could be a relevant example, as a significant thyroidal cancer incidence increase can be noticed in the most severely affected states.",

If you instead want to immediately get started with Keras, check out the collection of Keras guides . In this guide, you'll learn how TensorFlow allows you to make simple changes to your code to get graphs, how graphs are stored and represented, and how you can use them to accelerate your models. Note: For those of you who are only familiar with TensorFlow 1.x, this guide demonstrates a very different view of graphs. This is a big-picture overview that covers how tf.function allows you to switch from eager execution to graph execution. For a more complete specification of tf.function , go to the Better performance with tf.function guide. What are graphs? In the previous three guides, you ran TensorFlow eagerly .",

This means TensorFlow operations are executed by Python, operation by operation, and return results back to Python. While eager execution has several unique advantages, graph execution enables portability outside Python and tends to offer better performance. Graph execution means that tensor computations are executed as a TensorFlow graph , sometimes referred to as a tf.Graph or simply a \"graph.\" Graphs are data structures that contain a set of tf.Operation objects, which represent units of computation; and tf.Tensor objects, which represent the units of data that flow between operations. They are defined in a tf.Graph context. Since these graphs are data structures, they can be saved, run, and restored all without the original Python code. This is what a TensorFlow graph representing a two-layer neural network looks like when visualized in TensorBoard: The benefits of graphs With a graph, you have a great deal of flexibility.",

You can use your TensorFlow graph in environments that don't have a Python interpreter, like mobile applications, embedded devices, and backend servers. TensorFlow uses graphs as the format for saved models when it exports them from Python. Graphs are also easily optimized, allowing the compiler to do transformations like: Statically infer the value of tensors by folding constant nodes in your computation (\"constant folding\") . Separate sub-parts of a computation that are independent and split them between threads or devices. Simplify arithmetic operations by eliminating common subexpressions. There is an entire optimization system, Grappler , to perform this and other speedups. In short, graphs are extremely useful and let your TensorFlow run fast , run in parallel , and run efficiently on multiple devices . However, you still want to define your machine learning models (or other computations) in Python for convenience, and then automatically construct graphs when you need them.",

Each time you invoke a tf.function with a set of arguments that can't be handled by any of its existing graphs (such as arguments with new dtypes or incompatible shapes), it creates a new tf.Graph specialized to those new arguments. The type specification of a tf.Graph 's inputs is represented by tf.types.experimental.FunctionType , also referred to as the signature . For more information regarding when a new tf.Graph is generated, how that can be controlled, and how FunctionType can be useful, go to the Rules of tracing section of the Better performance with tf.function guide.
