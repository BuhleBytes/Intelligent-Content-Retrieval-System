If you instead want to immediately get started with Keras, check out the collection of Keras guides.\nIn this guide, you'll learn how TensorFlow allows you to make simple changes to your code to get graphs, how graphs are stored and represented, and how you can use them to accelerate your models.\nThis is a big-picture overview that covers how tf.function\nallows you to switch from eager execution to graph execution. For a more complete specification of tf.function\n, go to the Better performance with tf.function\nguide.\nWhat are graphs?\nIn the previous three guides, you ran TensorFlow eagerly. This means TensorFlow operations are executed by Python, operation by operation, and return results back to Python.\nWhile eager execution has several unique advantages, graph execution enables portability outside Python and tends to offer better performance. Graph execution means that tensor computations are executed as a TensorFlow graph, sometimes referred to as a tf.Graph\nor simply a \"graph.\"\nGraphs are data structures that contain a set of tf.Operation\nobjects, which represent units of computation; and tf.Tensor\nobjects, which represent the units of data that flow between operations. They are defined in a tf.Graph\ncontext. Since these graphs are data structures, they can be saved, run, and restored all without the original Python code.\nThis is what a TensorFlow graph representing a two-layer neural network looks like when visualized in TensorBoard:\nThe benefits of graphs\nWith a graph, you have a great deal of flexibility. You can use your TensorFlow graph in environments that don't have a Python interpreter, like mobile applications, embedded devices, and backend servers. TensorFlow uses graphs as the format for saved models when it exports them from Python.\nGraphs are also easily optimized, allowing the compiler to do transformations like:\n- Statically infer the value of tensors by folding constant nodes in your computation (\"constant folding\").\n- Separate sub-parts of a computation that are independent and split them between threads or devices.\n- Simplify arithmetic operations by eliminating common subexpressions.\nThere is an entire optimization system, Grappler, to perform this and other speedups.\nIn short, graphs are extremely useful and let your TensorFlow run fast, run in parallel, and run efficiently on multiple devices.\nHowever, you still want to define your machine learning models (or other computations) in Python for convenience, and then automatically construct graphs when you need them.\nSetup\nImport some necessary libraries:\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport timeit\nfrom datetime import datetime\n2024-08-15 01:23:58.511668: E external/local_xla/xla/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_fft.cc:485] Unable to register cuFFT factory: Attempting to register factory for plugin cuFFT when one has already been registered 2024-08-15 01:23:58.532403: E external/local_xla/xla/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_dnn.cc:8454] Unable to register cuDNN factory: Attempting to register factory for plugin cuDNN when one has already been registered 2024-08-15 01:23:58.538519: E external/local_xla/xla/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_blas.cc:1452] Unable to register cuBLAS factory: Attempting to register factory for plugin cuBLAS when one has already been registered\nTaking advantage of graphs\nYou create and run a graph in TensorFlow by using tf.function\n, either as a direct call or as a decorator. tf.function\ntakes a regular function as input and returns a tf.types.experimental.PolymorphicFunction\n. A PolymorphicFunction\nis a Python callable that builds TensorFlow graphs from the Python function. You use a tf.function\nin the same way as its Python equivalent.\n# Define a Python function.\ndef a_regular_function(x, y, b):\nx = tf.matmul(x, y)\nx = x + b\nreturn x\n# The Python type of `a_function_that_uses_a_graph` will now be a\n# `PolymorphicFunction`.\na_function_that_uses_a_graph = tf.function(a_regular_function)\n# Make some tensors.\nx1 = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0]])\ny1 = tf.constant([[2.0], [3.0]])\nb1 = tf.constant(4.0)\norig_value = a_regular_function(x1, y1, b1).numpy()\n# Call a `tf.function` like a Python function.\ntf_function_value = a_function_that_uses_a_graph(x1, y1, b1).numpy()\nassert(orig_value == tf_function_value)\nWARNING: All log messages before absl::InitializeLog() is called are written to STDERR I0000 00:00:1723685041.078349 10585 cuda_executor.cc:1015] successful NUMA node read from SysFS had negative value (-1), but there must be at least one NUMA node, so returning NUMA node zero.

Underneath, however, it is very different. The underlying PolymorphicFunction\nencapsulates several tf.Graph\ns behind one API (learn more in the Polymorphism section). That is how a tf.function\nis able to give you the benefits of graph execution, like speed and deployability (refer to The benefits of graphs above).\ntf.function\napplies to a function and all other functions it calls:\ndef inner_function(x, y, b):\nx = tf.matmul(x, y)\nx = x + b\nreturn x\n# Using the `tf.function` decorator makes `outer_function` into a\n# `PolymorphicFunction`.\n@tf.function\ndef outer_function(x):\ny = tf.constant([[2.0], [3.0]])\nb = tf.constant(4.0)\nreturn inner_function(x, y, b)\n# Note that the callable will create a graph that\n# includes `inner_function` as well as `outer_function`.\nouter_function(tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0]])).numpy()\narray([[12.]], dtype=float32)\nIf you have used TensorFlow 1.x, you will notice that at no time did you need to define a Placeholder\nor tf.Session\n.\nConverting Python functions to graphs\nAny function you write with TensorFlow will contain a mixture of built-in TF operations and Python logic, such as if-then\nclauses, loops, break\n, return\n, continue\n, and more. While TensorFlow operations are easily captured by a tf.Graph\n, Python-specific logic needs to undergo an extra step in order to become part of the graph. tf.function\nuses a library called AutoGraph (tf.autograph\n) to convert Python code into graph-generating code.\ndef simple_relu(x):\nif tf.greater(x, 0):\nreturn x\nelse:\nreturn 0\n# Using `tf.function` makes `tf_simple_relu` a `PolymorphicFunction` that wraps\n# `simple_relu`.\ntf_simple_relu = tf.function(simple_relu)\nprint(\"First branch, with graph:\", tf_simple_relu(tf.constant(1)).numpy())\nprint(\"Second branch, with graph:\", tf_simple_relu(tf.constant(-1)).numpy())\nFirst branch, with graph: 1 Second branch, with graph: 0\nThough it is unlikely that you will need to view graphs directly, you can inspect the outputs to check the exact results.

However, there are some caveats, and the tf.function\nguide can help here, as well as the complete AutoGraph reference.\nPolymorphism: one tf.function\n, many graphs\nA tf.Graph\nis specialized to a specific type of inputs (for example, tensors with a specific dtype\nor objects with the same id()\n).\nEach time you invoke a tf.function\nwith a set of arguments that can't be handled by any of its existing graphs (such as arguments with new dtypes\nor incompatible shapes), it creates a new tf.Graph\nspecialized to those new arguments. The type specification of a tf.Graph\n's inputs is represented by tf.types.experimental.FunctionType\n, also referred to as the signature. For more information regarding when a new tf.Graph\nis generated, how that can be controlled, and how FunctionType\ncan be useful, go to the Rules of tracing section of the Better performance with tf.function\nguide.\nThe tf.function\nstores the tf.Graph\ncorresponding to that signature in a ConcreteFunction\n. A ConcreteFunction\ncan be thought of as a wrapper around a tf.Graph\n.\n@tf.function\ndef my_relu(x):\nreturn tf.maximum(0., x)\n# `my_relu` creates new graphs as it observes different input types.\nprint(my_relu(tf.constant(5.5)))\nprint(my_relu([1, -1]))\nprint(my_relu(tf.constant([3., -3.])))\ntf.Tensor(5.5, shape=(), dtype=float32) tf.Tensor([1. 0.], shape=(2,), dtype=float32) tf.Tensor([3. 0.], shape=(2,), dtype=float32)\nIf the tf.function\nhas already been called with the same input types, it does not create a new tf.Graph\n.\n# These two calls do *not* create new graphs.\nprint(my_relu(tf.constant(-2.5))) # Input type matches `tf.constant(5.5)`.\nprint(my_relu(tf.constant([-1., 1.]))) # Input type matches `tf.constant([3., -3.])`.\ntf.Tensor(0.0, shape=(), dtype=float32) tf.Tensor([0. 1.], shape=(2,), dtype=float32)\nBecause it's backed by multiple graphs, a tf.function\nis (as the name \"PolymorphicFunction\" suggests) polymorphic. That enables it to support more input types than a single tf.Graph\ncould represent, and to optimize each tf.Graph\nfor better performance.\n# There are three `ConcreteFunction`s (one for each graph) in `my_relu`.\n# The `ConcreteFunction` also knows the return type and shape!\nprint(my_relu.pretty_printed_concrete_signatures())\nInput Parameters: x (POSITIONAL_OR_KEYWORD): TensorSpec(shape=(), dtype=tf.float32, name=None) Output Type: TensorSpec(shape=(), dtype=tf.float32, name=None) Captures: None Input Parameters: x (POSITIONAL_OR_KEYWORD): List[Literal[1], Literal[-1]] Output Type: TensorSpec(shape=(2,), dtype=tf.float32, name=None) Captures: None Input Parameters: x (POSITIONAL_OR_KEYWORD): TensorSpec(shape=(2,), dtype=tf.float32, name=None) Output Type: TensorSpec(shape=(2,), dtype=tf.float32, name=None) Captures: None\nUsing tf.function\nSo far, you've learned how to convert a Python function into a graph simply by using tf.function\nas a decorator or wrapper. But in practice, getting tf.function\nto work correctly can be tricky! In the following sections, you'll learn how you can make your code work as expected with tf.function\n.\nGraph execution vs. eager execution\nThe code in a tf.function\ncan be executed both eagerly and as a graph. By default, tf.function\nexecutes its code as a graph:\n@tf.function\ndef get_MSE(y_true, y_pred):\nsq_diff = tf.pow(y_true - y_pred, 2)\nreturn tf.reduce_mean(sq_diff)\ny_true = tf.random.uniform([5], maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32)\ny_pred = tf.random.uniform([5], maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32)\nprint(y_true)\nprint(y_pred)\ntf.Tensor([2 0 7 2 3], shape=(5,), dtype=int32) tf.Tensor([9 9 1 1 5], shape=(5,), dtype=int32)\nget_MSE(y_true, y_pred)\n<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=int32, numpy=34>\nTo verify that your tf.function\n's graph is doing the same computation as its equivalent Python function, you can make it execute eagerly with tf.config.run_functions_eagerly(True)\n. This is a switch that turns off tf.function\n's ability to create and run graphs, instead of executing the code normally.\ntf.config.run_functions_eagerly(True)\nget_MSE(y_true, y_pred)\n<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=int32, numpy=34>\n# Don't forget to set it back when you are done.\ntf.config.run_functions_eagerly(False)\nHowever, tf.function\ncan behave differently under graph and eager execution. The Python print\nfunction is one example of how these two modes differ. Let's check out what happens when you insert a print\nstatement to your function and call it repeatedly.\n@tf.function\ndef get_MSE(y_true, y_pred):\nprint(\"Calculating MSE!\")\nsq_diff = tf.pow(y_true - y_pred, 2)\nreturn tf.reduce_mean(sq_diff)\nObserve what is printed:\nerror = get_MSE(y_true, y_pred)\nerror = get_MSE(y_true, y_pred)\nerror = get_MSE(y_true, y_pred)\nCalculating MSE!\nIs the output surprising? get_MSE\nonly printed once even though it was called three times.\nTo explain, the print\nstatement is executed when tf.function\nruns the original code in order to create the graph in a process known as \"tracing\" (refer to the Tracing section of the tf.function\nguide. Tracing captures the TensorFlow operations into a graph, and print\nis not captured in the graph. That graph is then executed for all three calls without ever running the Python code again.\nAs a sanity check, let's turn off graph execution to compare:\n# Now, globally set everything to run eagerly to force eager execution.\ntf.config.run_functions_eagerly(True)\n# Observe what is printed below.\nerror = get_MSE(y_true, y_pred)\nerror = get_MSE(y_true, y_pred)\nerror = get_MSE(y_true, y_pred)\nCalculating MSE! Calculating MSE! Calculating MSE!\ntf.config.run_functions_eagerly(False)\nprint\nis a Python side effect, and there are other differences that you should be aware of when converting a function into a tf.function\n. Learn more in the Limitations section of the Better performance with tf.function\nguide.\nNon-strict execution\nGraph execution only executes the operations necessary to produce the observable effects, which include:\n- The return value of the function\n- Documented well-known side-effects such as:\n- Input/output operations, like\ntf.print\n- Debugging operations, such as the assert functions in\ntf.debugging\n- Mutations of\ntf.Variable\n- Input/output operations, like\nThis behavior is usually known as \"Non-strict execution\", and differs from eager execution, which steps through all of the program operations, needed or not.\nIn particular, runtime error checking does not count as an observable effect. If an operation is skipped because it is unnecessary, it cannot raise any runtime errors.\nIn the following example, the \"unnecessary\" operation tf.gather\nis skipped during graph execution, so the runtime error InvalidArgumentError\nis not raised as it would be in eager execution. Do not rely on an error being raised while executing a graph.\ndef unused_return_eager(x):\n# Get index 1 will fail when `len(x) == 1`\ntf.gather(x, [1]) # unused\nreturn x\ntry:\nprint(unused_return_eager(tf.constant([0.0])))\nexcept tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:\n# All operations are run during eager execution so an error is raised.\nprint(f'{type(e).__name__}: {e}')\ntf.Tensor([0.], shape=(1,), dtype=float32)\n@tf.function\ndef unused_return_graph(x):\ntf.gather(x, [1]) # unused\nreturn x\n# Only needed operations are run during graph execution. The error is not raised.\nprint(unused_return_graph(tf.constant([0.0])))\ntf.Tensor([0.], shape=(1,), dtype=float32)\ntf.function\nbest practices\nIt may take some time to get used to the behavior of tf.function\n. To get started quickly, first-time users should play around with decorating toy functions with @tf.function\nto get experience with going from eager to graph execution.\nDesigning for tf.function\nmay be your best bet for writing graph-compatible TensorFlow programs. Here are some tips:\n- Toggle between eager and graph execution early and often with\ntf.config.run_functions_eagerly\nto pinpoint if/ when the two modes diverge. - Create\ntf.Variable\ns outside the Python function and modify them on the inside. The same goes for objects that usetf.Variable\n, liketf.keras.layers\n,tf.keras.Model\ns andtf.keras.optimizers\n. - Avoid writing functions that depend on outer Python variables, excluding\ntf.Variable\ns and Keras objects. Learn more in Depending on Python global and free variables of thetf.function\nguide. - Prefer to write functions which take tensors and other TensorFlow types as input. You can pass in other object types but be careful! Learn more in Depending on Python objects of the\ntf.function\nguide. - Include as much computation as possible under a\ntf.function\nto maximize the performance gain. For example, decorate a whole training step or the entire training loop.\nSeeing the speed-up\ntf.function\nusually improves the performance of your code, but the amount of speed-up depends on the kind of computation you run. Small computations can be dominated by the overhead of calling a graph. You can measure the difference in performance like so:\nx = tf.random.uniform(shape=[10, 10], minval=-1, maxval=2, dtype=tf.dtypes.int32)\ndef power(x, y):\nresult = tf.eye(10, dtype=tf.dtypes.int32)\nfor _ in range(y):\nresult = tf.matmul(x, result)\nreturn result\nprint(\"Eager execution:\", timeit.timeit(lambda: power(x, 100), number=1000), \"seconds\")\nEager execution: 4.1027931490000356 seconds\npower_as_graph = tf.function(power)\nprint(\"Graph execution:\", timeit.timeit(lambda: power_as_graph(x, 100), number=1000), \"seconds\")\nGraph execution: 0.7951284349999241 seconds\ntf.function\nis commonly used to speed up training loops, and you can learn more about it in the _Speeding-up your training step with tf.function\n_ section of the Writing a training loop from scratch with Keras guide.\nPerformance and trade-offs\nGraphs can speed up your code, but the process of creating them has some overhead. For some functions, the creation of the graph takes more time than the execution of the graph. This investment is usually quickly paid back with the performance boost of subsequent executions, but it's important to be aware that the first few steps of any large model training can be slower due to tracing.\nNo matter how large your model, you want to avoid tracing frequently. In the Controlling retracing section, the tf.function\nguide discusses how to set input specifications and use tensor arguments to avoid retracing. If you find you are getting unusually poor performance, it's a good idea to check if you are retracing accidentally.\nWhen is a tf.function\ntracing?\nTo figure out when your tf.function\nis tracing, add a print\nstatement to its code. As a rule of thumb, tf.function\nwill execute the print\nstatement every time it traces.\n@tf.function\ndef a_function_with_python_side_effect(x):\nprint(\"Tracing!\") # An eager-only side effect.\nreturn x * x + tf.constant(2)\n# This is traced the first time.\nprint(a_function_with_python_side_effect(tf.constant(2)))\n# The second time through, you won't see the side effect.\nprint(a_function_with_python_side_effect(tf.constant(3)))\nTracing! tf.Tensor(6, shape=(), dtype=int32) tf.Tensor(11, shape=(), dtype=int32)\n# This retraces each time the Python argument changes,\n# as a Python argument could be an epoch count or other\n# hyperparameter.\nprint(a_function_with_python_side_effect(2))\nprint(a_function_with_python_side_effect(3))\nTracing! tf.Tensor(6, shape=(), dtype=int32) Tracing! tf.Tensor(11, shape=(), dtype=int32)\nNew Python arguments always trigger the creation of a new graph, hence the extra tracing.\nNext steps\nYou can learn more about tf.function\non the API reference page and by following the Better performance with tf.function\nguide.",
