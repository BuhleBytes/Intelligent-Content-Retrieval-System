study\n\nin\n\nartificial intelligence\n\nconcerned with the development and study of\n\nstatistical algorithms\n\nthat can learn from\n\ndata\n\nand\n\ngeneralise\n\nto unseen data, and thus perform\n\ntasks\n\nwithout explicit\n\ninstructions\n\n.\n\n[\n\n1\n\n]\n\nWithin a subdiscipline in machine learning, advances in the field of\n\ndeep learning\n\nhave allowed\n\nneural networks\n\n, a class of statistical algorithms, to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance.\n\nML finds application in many fields, including\n\nnatural language processing\n\n,\n\ncomputer vision\n\n,\n\nspeech recognition\n\n,\n\nemail filtering\n\n,\n\nagriculture\n\n, and\n\nmedicine\n\n. The application of ML to business problems is known as\n\npredictive analytics\n\n.\n\nStatistics\n\nand\n\nmathematical optimisation\n\n(mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning.\n\nData mining\n\nis a related field of study, focusing on\n\nexploratory data analysis\n\n(EDA) through\n\nunsupervised learning\n\n.\n\n[\n\n3\n\n]\n\n[\n\n4\n\n]\n\nFrom a theoretical viewpoint,\n\nprobably approximately correct learning\n\nprovides a mathematical and statistical framework for describing machine learning. Most traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be described as\n\nempirical risk minimisation\n\nunder this framework.\n\nHistory\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nSee also:\n\nTimeline of machine learning\n\nThe term\n\nmachine learning\n\nwas coined in 1959 by\n\nArthur Samuel\n\n, an\n\nIBM\n\nemployee and pioneer in the field of\n\ncomputer gaming\n\nand\n\nartificial intelligence\n\n.\n\n[\n\n5\n\n]\n\n[\n\n6\n\n]\n\nThe synonym\n\nself-teaching computers\n\nwas also used during this time period.\n\n[\n\n7\n\n]\n\n[\n\n8\n\n]\n\nThe earliest machine learning program was introduced in the 1950s when\n\nArthur Samuel\n\ninvented a\n\ncomputer program\n\nthat calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, but the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes.\n\n[\n\n9\n\n]\n\nIn 1949,\n\nCanadian\n\npsychologist\n\nDonald Hebb\n\npublished the book\n\nThe Organization of Behavior\n\n, in which he introduced a\n\ntheoretical neural structure\n\nformed by certain interactions among\n\nnerve cells\n\n.\n\n[\n\n10\n\n]\n\nHebb's model\n\nof\n\nneurons\n\ninteracting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or\n\nartificial neurons\n\nused by computers to communicate data.\n\n[\n\n9\n\n]\n\nOther researchers who have studied human\n\ncognitive systems\n\ncontributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician\n\nWalter Pitts\n\nand\n\nWarren McCulloch\n\n, who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with\n\nalgorithms\n\nthat mirror human thought processes.\n\n[\n\n9\n\n]\n\nBy the early 1960s, an experimental \"learning machine\" with\n\npunched tape\n\nmemory, called Cybertron, had been developed by\n\nRaytheon Company\n\nto analyse\n\nsonar\n\nsignals,\n\nelectrocardiograms\n\n, and speech patterns using rudimentary\n\nreinforcement learning\n\n. It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognise patterns and equipped with a \"\n\ngoof\n\n\" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions.\n\n[\n\n11\n\n]\n\nA representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was\n\nNils Nilsson\n\n's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification.\n\n[\n\n12\n\n]\n\nInterest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973.\n\n[\n\n13\n\n]\n\nIn 1981, a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an\n\nartificial neural network\n\nlearns to recognise 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.\n\n[\n\n14\n\n]\n\nTom M. Mitchell\n\nprovided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience\n\nE\n\nwith respect to some class of tasks\n\nT\n\nand performance measure\n\nP\n\nif its performance at tasks in\n\nT\n\n, as measured by\n\nP\n\n,  improves with experience\n\nE\n\n.\"\n\n[\n\n15\n\n]\n\nThis definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally\n\noperational definition\n\nrather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows\n\nAlan Turing\n\n's proposal in his paper \"\n\nComputing Machinery and Intelligence\n\n\", in which the question, \"Can machines think?\", is replaced with the question, \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\".\n\n[\n\n16\n\n]\n\nModern-day Machine Learning algorithms are broken into 3 algorithm types: Supervised Learning Algorithms, Unsupervised Learning Algorithms, and Reinforcement Learning Algorithms.\n\n[\n\n17\n\n]\n\nCurrent Supervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of classification and regression.\n\nCurrent Unsupervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule.\n\nCurrent Reinforcement Learning Algorithms focus on decisions that must be made with respect to some previous, unknown time and are broken down to either be studies of model-based methods or model-free methods.\n\nIn 2014 Ian Goodfellow and others introduced generative adversarial networks (GANs) with realistic data synthesis.\n\n[\n\n18\n\n]\n\nBy 2016 AlphaGo obtained victory against top human players using reinforcement learning techniques.\n\n[\n\n19\n\n]\n\nRelationships to other fields\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nDeep learning\n\nis a subset of machine learning, which is itself a subset of\n\nartificial intelligence\n\n.\n\n[\n\n20\n\n]\n\nAs a scientific endeavour, machine learning grew out of the quest for\n\nartificial intelligence\n\n(AI). In the early days of AI as an\n\nacademic discipline\n\n, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed \"\n\nneural networks\n\n\"; these were mostly\n\nperceptrons\n\nand\n\nother models\n\nthat were later found to be reinventions of the\n\ngeneralised linear models\n\nof statistics.\n\n[\n\n21\n\n]\n\nProbabilistic reasoning\n\nwas also employed, especially in\n\nautomated medical diagnosis\n\n.\n\n[\n\n22\n\n]\n\n: 488\n\nHowever, an increasing emphasis on the\n\nlogical, knowledge-based approach\n\ncaused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.\n\n[\n\n22\n\n]\n\n: 488\n\nBy 1980,\n\nexpert systems\n\nhad come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favour.\n\n[\n\n23\n\n]\n\nWork on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to\n\ninductive logic programming\n\n(ILP), but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in\n\npattern recognition\n\nand\n\ninformation retrieval\n\n.\n\n[\n\n22\n\n]\n\n: 708–710, 755\n\nNeural networks research had been abandoned by AI and\n\ncomputer science\n\naround the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as \"\n\nconnectionism\n\n\", by researchers from other disciplines, including\n\nJohn Hopfield\n\n,\n\nDavid Rumelhart\n\n, and\n\nGeoffrey Hinton\n\n. Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of\n\nbackpropagation\n\n.\n\n[\n\n22\n\n]\n\n: 25\n\nMachine learning (ML), reorganised and recognised as its own field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the\n\nsymbolic approaches\n\nit had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics,\n\nfuzzy logic\n\n, and\n\nprobability theory\n\n.\n\n[\n\n23\n\n]\n\nData compression\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nThis section is an excerpt from\n\nData compression § Machine learning\n\n.\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nThere is a close connection between machine learning and compression. A system that predicts the\n\nposterior probabilities\n\nof a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using\n\narithmetic coding\n\non the output distribution). Conversely, an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for \"general intelligence\".\n\n[\n\n24\n\n]\n\n[\n\n25\n\n]\n\n[\n\n26\n\n]\n\nAn alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit\n\nfeature space vectors\n\n, and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. For each compressor C(.) we define an associated vector space ℵ, such that C(.) maps an input string x, corresponding to the vector norm ||~x||. An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space; instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods, LZW, LZ77, and PPM.\n\n[\n\n27\n\n]\n\nAccording to\n\nAIXI\n\ntheory, a connection more directly explained in\n\nHutter Prize\n\n, the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x. For example, in that model, a zip file's compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software, since you can not unzip it without both, but there may be an even smaller combined form.\n\nExamples of AI-powered audio/video compression software include\n\nNVIDIA Maxine\n\n, AIVC.\n\n[\n\n28\n\n]\n\nExamples of software that can perform AI-powered image compression include\n\nOpenCV\n\n,\n\nTensorFlow\n\n,\n\nMATLAB\n\n's Image Processing Toolbox (IPT) and High-Fidelity Generative Image Compression.\n\n[\n\n29\n\n]\n\nIn\n\nunsupervised machine learning\n\n,\n\nk-means clustering\n\ncan be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters. This technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as\n\nimage compression\n\n.\n\n[\n\n30\n\n]\n\nData compression aims to reduce the size of data files, enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission. K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters, k, each represented by the\n\ncentroid\n\nof its points. This process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points. Particularly beneficial in\n\nimage\n\nand\n\nsignal processing\n\n, k-means clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids, thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space.\n\n[\n\n31\n\n]\n\nLarge language models\n\n(LLMs) are also efficient lossless data compressors on some data sets, as demonstrated by\n\nDeepMind\n\n's research with the Chinchilla 70B model. Developed by DeepMind, Chinchilla 70B effectively compressed data, outperforming conventional methods such as\n\nPortable Network Graphics\n\n(PNG) for images and\n\nFree Lossless Audio Codec\n\n(FLAC) for audio. It achieved compression of image and audio data to 43.4% and 16.4% of their original sizes, respectively. There is, however, some reason to be concerned that the data set used for testing overlaps the LLM training data set, making it possible that the Chinchilla 70B model is only an efficient compression tool on data it has already been trained on.\n\n[\n\n32\n\n]\n\n[\n\n33\n\n]\n\nData mining\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nMachine learning and\n\ndata mining\n\noften employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on\n\nknown\n\nproperties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the\n\ndiscovery\n\nof (previously)\n\nunknown\n\nproperties in the data (this is the analysis step of\n\nknowledge discovery\n\nin databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \"\n\nunsupervised learning\n\n\" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals,\n\nECML PKDD\n\nbeing a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to\n\nreproduce known\n\nknowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously\n\nunknown\n\nknowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.\n\n[\n\ncitation needed\n\n]\n\nMachine learning also has intimate ties to\n\noptimisation\n\n: Many learning problems are formulated as minimisation of some\n\nloss function\n\non a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a\n\nlabel\n\nto instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples).\n\n[\n\n34\n\n]\n\nGeneralization\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nCharacterizing the generalisation of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for\n\ndeep learning\n\nalgorithms.\n\nStatistics\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nMachine learning and\n\nstatistics\n\nare closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population\n\ninferences\n\nfrom a\n\nsample\n\n, while machine learning finds generalisable predictive patterns.\n\n[\n\n35\n\n]\n\nConventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set. In addition, only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis. In contrast, machine learning is not built on a pre-structured model; rather, the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns. The more variables (input) used to train the model, the more accurate the ultimate model will be.\n\n[\n\n36\n\n]\n\nLeo Breiman\n\ndistinguished two statistical modelling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model,\n\n[\n\n37\n\n]\n\nwherein \"algorithmic model\" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like\n\nRandom Forest\n\n.\n\nSome statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call\n\nstatistical learning\n\n.\n\n[\n\n38\n\n]\n\nStatistical physics\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nAnalytical and computational techniques derived from deep-rooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to large-scale problems, including machine learning, e.g., to analyse the weight space of\n\ndeep neural networks\n\n.\n\n[\n\n39\n\n]\n\nStatistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of\n\nmedical diagnostics\n\n.\n\n[\n\n40\n\n]\n\nTheory\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nMain articles:\n\nComputational learning theory\n\nand\n\nStatistical learning theory\n\nA core objective of a learner is to generalise from its experience.\n\n[\n\n2\n\n]\n\n[\n\n41\n\n]\n\nGeneralization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases.\n\nThe computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of\n\ntheoretical computer science\n\nknown as\n\ncomputational learning theory\n\nvia the\n\nprobably approximately correct learning\n\nmodel. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The\n\nbias–variance decomposition\n\nis one way to quantify generalisation\n\nerror\n\n.\n\nFor the best performance in the context of generalisation, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has underfitted the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to\n\noverfitting\n\nand generalisation will be poorer.\n\n[\n\n42\n\n]\n\nIn addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in\n\npolynomial time\n\n. There are two kinds of\n\ntime complexity\n\nresults: Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.\n\nApproaches\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nIn\n\nsupervised learning\n\n, the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in\n\nunsupervised learning\n\n, the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data.\n\nMachine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the \"signal\" or \"feedback\" available to the learning system:\n\nSupervised learning\n\n: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a \"teacher\", and the goal is to learn a general rule that\n\nmaps\n\ninputs to outputs.\n\nUnsupervised learning\n\n: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (\n\nfeature learning\n\n).\n\nReinforcement learning\n\n: A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as\n\ndriving a vehicle\n\nor playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximise.\n\n[\n\n2\n\n]\n\nAlthough each algorithm has advantages and limitations, no single algorithm works for all problems.\n\n[\n\n43\n\n]\n\n[\n\n44\n\n]\n\n[\n\n45\n\n]\n\nSupervised learning\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nMain article:\n\nSupervised learning\n\nA\n\nsupport-vector machine\n\nis a supervised learning model that divides the data into regions separated by a\n\nlinear boundary\n\n. Here, the linear boundary divides the black circles from the white.\n\nSupervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs.\n\n[\n\n46\n\n]\n\nThe data, known as\n\ntraining data\n\n, consists of a set of training examples. Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an\n\narray\n\nor vector, sometimes called a\n\nfeature vector\n\n, and the training data is represented by a\n\nmatrix\n\n. Through\n\niterative optimisation\n\nof an\n\nobjective function\n\n, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs.\n\n[\n\n47\n\n]\n\nAn optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task.\n\n[\n\n15\n\n]\n\nTypes of supervised-learning algorithms include\n\nactive learning\n\n,\n\nclassification\n\nand\n\nregression\n\n.\n\n[\n\n48\n\n]\n\nClassification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, while regression algorithms are used when the outputs can take any numerical value within a range. For example, in a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input is an incoming email, and the output is the folder in which to file the email. In contrast, regression is used for tasks such as predicting a person's height based on factors like age and genetics or forecasting future temperatures based on historical data.\n\n[\n\n49\n\n]\n\nSimilarity learning\n\nis an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in\n\nranking\n\n,\n\nrecommendation systems\n\n, visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification.\n\nUnsupervised learning\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nMain article:\n\nUnsupervised learning\n\nSee also:\n\nCluster analysis\n\nUnsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labelled, classified or categorised. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. Central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering,\n\ndimensionality reduction\n\n,\n\n[\n\n4\n\n]\n\nand\n\ndensity estimation\n\n.\n\n[\n\n50\n\n]\n\nCluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called\n\nclusters\n\n) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some\n\nsimilarity metric\n\nand evaluated, for example, by\n\ninternal compactness\n\n, or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and\n\nseparation\n\n, the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on\n\nestimated density\n\nand\n\ngraph connectivity\n\n.\n\nA special type of unsupervised learning called,\n\nself-supervised learning\n\ninvolves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself.\n\n[\n\n51\n\n]\n\n[\n\n52\n\n]\n\nSemi-supervised learning\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nMain article:\n\nSemi-supervised learning\n\nSemi-supervised learning falls between\n\nunsupervised learning\n\n(without any labelled training data) and\n\nsupervised learning\n\n(with completely labelled training data). Some of the training examples are missing training labels, yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabelled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labelled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy.\n\nIn\n\nweakly supervised learning\n\n, the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets.\n\n[\n\n53\n\n]\n\nReinforcement learning\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nMain article:\n\nReinforcement learning\n\nIn reinforcement learning, an agent takes actions in an environment: these produce a reward and/or a representation of the state, which is fed back to the agent.\n\nReinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how\n\nsoftware agents\n\nought to take\n\nactions\n\nin an environment to maximise some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as\n\ngame theory\n\n,\n\ncontrol theory\n\n,\n\noperations research\n\n,\n\ninformation theory\n\n,\n\nsimulation-based optimisation\n\n,\n\nmulti-agent systems\n\n,\n\nswarm intelligence\n\n,\n\nstatistics\n\nand\n\ngenetic algorithms\n\n. In reinforcement learning, the environment is typically represented as a\n\nMarkov decision process\n\n(MDP). Many reinforcement learning algorithms use\n\ndynamic programming\n\ntechniques.\n\n[\n\n54\n\n]\n\nReinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and are used when exact models are infeasible. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent.\n\nDimensionality reduction\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nDimensionality reduction\n\nis a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables.\n\n[\n\n55\n\n]\n\nIn other words, it is a process of reducing the dimension of the\n\nfeature\n\nset, also called the \"number of features\". Most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or\n\nextraction\n\n. One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is\n\nprincipal component analysis\n\n(PCA). PCA involves changing higher-dimensional data (e.g., 3D) to a smaller space (e.g., 2D).\nThe\n\nmanifold hypothesis\n\nproposes that high-dimensional data sets lie along low-dimensional\n\nmanifolds\n\n, and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption, leading to the areas of\n\nmanifold learning\n\nand\n\nmanifold regularisation\n\n.\n\nOther types\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nOther approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this three-fold categorisation, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system. For example,\n\ntopic modelling\n\n,\n\nmeta-learning\n\n.\n\n[\n\n56\n\n]\n\nSelf-learning\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nSelf-learning, as a machine learning paradigm, was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning, named\n\ncrossbar adaptive array\n\n(CAA).\n\n[\n\n57\n\n]\n\n[\n\n58\n\n]\n\nIt gives a solution to the problem learning without any external reward, by introducing emotion as an internal reward. Emotion is used as a state evaluation of a self-learning agent. The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion.\n\n[\n\n59\n\n]\n\nThe self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine:\n\nin situation\n\ns\n\nact\n\na\n\nreceive a consequence situation\n\ns\n\n'\n\ncompute emotion of being in the consequence situation\n\nv(s')\n\nupdate crossbar memory\n\nw'(a,s) = w(a,s) + v(s')\n\nIt is a system with only one input, situation, and only one output, action (or behaviour) a. There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioural environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioural environment. After receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal-seeking behaviour in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations.\n\n[\n\n60\n\n]\n\nFeature learning\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nMain article:\n\nFeature learning\n\nSeveral learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training.\n\n[\n\n61\n\n]\n\nClassic examples include\n\nprincipal component analysis\n\nand cluster analysis. Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions. This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. This replaces manual\n\nfeature engineering\n\n, and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task.\n\nFeature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labelled input data. Examples include\n\nartificial neural networks\n\n,\n\nmultilayer perceptrons\n\n, and supervised\n\ndictionary learning\n\n. In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabelled input data.  Examples include dictionary learning,\n\nindependent component analysis\n\n,\n\nautoencoders\n\n,\n\nmatrix factorisation\n\n[\n\n62\n\n]\n\nand various forms of\n\nclustering\n\n.\n\n[\n\n63\n\n]\n\n[\n\n64\n\n]\n\n[\n\n65\n\n]\n\nManifold learning\n\nalgorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional.\n\nSparse coding\n\nalgorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros.\n\nMultilinear subspace learning\n\nalgorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from\n\ntensor\n\nrepresentations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors.\n\n[\n\n66\n\n]\n\nDeep learning\n\nalgorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent machine learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data.\n\n[\n\n67\n\n]\n\nFeature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data have not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms.\n\nSparse dictionary learning\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nMain article:\n\nSparse dictionary learning\n\nSparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of\n\nbasis functions\n\nand assumed to be a\n\nsparse matrix\n\n. The method is\n\nstrongly NP-hard\n\nand difficult to solve approximately.\n\n[\n\n68\n\n]\n\nA popular\n\nheuristic\n\nmethod for sparse dictionary learning is the\n\nk\n\n-SVD\n\nalgorithm. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in\n\nimage denoising\n\n. The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.\n\n[\n\n69\n\n]\n\nAnomaly detection\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nMain article:\n\nAnomaly detection\n\nIn\n\ndata mining\n\n, anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations that raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.\n\n[\n\n70\n\n]\n\nTypically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as\n\nbank fraud\n\n, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are referred to as\n\noutliers\n\n, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.\n\n[\n\n71\n\n]\n\nIn particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare, but unexpected bursts of inactivity. This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object. Many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately. Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns.\n\n[\n\n72\n\n]\n\nThree broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist.\n\n[\n\n73\n\n]\n\nUnsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabelled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set. Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labelled as \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" and involves training a classifier (the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behaviour from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance being generated by the model.\n\nRobot learning\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nRobot learning\n\nis inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods, starting from supervised learning, reinforcement learning,\n\n[\n\n74\n\n]\n\n[\n\n75\n\n]\n\nand finally\n\nmeta-learning\n\n(e.g. MAML).\n\nAssociation rules\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nMain article:\n\nAssociation rule learning\n\nSee also:\n\nInductive logic programming\n\nAssociation rule learning is a\n\nrule-based machine learning\n\nmethod for discovering relationships between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of \"interestingness\".\n\n[\n\n76\n\n]\n\nRule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves \"rules\" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilisation of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.\n\n[\n\n77\n\n]\n\nRule-based machine learning approaches include\n\nlearning classifier systems\n\n, association rule learning, and\n\nartificial immune systems\n\n.\n\nBased on the concept of strong rules,\n\nRakesh Agrawal\n\n,\n\nTomasz Imieliński\n\nand Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by\n\npoint-of-sale\n\n(POS) systems in supermarkets.\n\n[\n\n78\n\n]\n\nFor example, the rule\n\n{\n\no\n\nn\n\ni\n\no\n\nn\n\ns\n\n,\n\np\n\no\n\nt\n\na\n\nt\n\no\n\ne\n\ns\n\n}\n\n⇒\n\n{\n\nb\n\nu\n\nr\n\ng\n\ne\n\nr\n\n}\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{\\mathrm {onions,potatoes} \\}\\Rightarrow \\{\\mathrm {burger} \\}}\n\nfound in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional\n\npricing\n\nor\n\nproduct placements\n\n. In addition to\n\nmarket basket analysis\n\n, association rules are employed today in application areas including\n\nWeb usage mining\n\n,\n\nintrusion detection\n\n,\n\ncontinuous production\n\n, and\n\nbioinformatics\n\n. In contrast with\n\nsequence mining\n\n, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.\n\nLearning classifier systems\n\n(LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a\n\ngenetic algorithm\n\n, with a learning component, performing either\n\nsupervised learning\n\n,\n\nreinforcement learning\n\n, or\n\nunsupervised learning\n\n. They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a\n\npiecewise\n\nmanner to make predictions.\n\n[\n\n79\n\n]\n\nInductive logic programming\n\n(ILP) is an approach to rule learning using\n\nlogic programming\n\nas a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that\n\nentails\n\nall positive and no negative examples.\n\nInductive programming\n\nis a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as\n\nfunctional programs\n\n.\n\nInductive logic programming is particularly useful in\n\nbioinformatics\n\nand\n\nnatural language processing\n\n.\n\nGordon Plotkin\n\nand\n\nEhud Shapiro\n\nlaid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting.\n\n[\n\n80\n\n]\n\n[\n\n81\n\n]\n\n[\n\n82\n\n]\n\nShapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a\n\nProlog\n\nprogram that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples.\n\n[\n\n83\n\n]\n\nThe term\n\ninductive\n\nhere refers to\n\nphilosophical\n\ninduction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than\n\nmathematical induction\n\n, proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set.\n\nModels\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nA\n\nmachine learning model\n\nis a type of\n\nmathematical model\n\nthat, once \"trained\" on a given dataset, can be used to make predictions or classifications on new data. During training, a learning algorithm iteratively adjusts the model's internal parameters to minimise errors in its predictions.\n\n[\n\n84\n\n]\n\nBy extension, the term \"model\" can refer to several levels of specificity, from a general class of models and their associated learning algorithms to a fully trained model with all its internal parameters tuned.\n\n[\n\n85\n\n]\n\nVarious types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems, picking the best model for a task is called\n\nmodel selection\n\n.\n\nArtificial neural networks\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nMain article:\n\nArtificial neural network\n\nSee also:\n\nDeep learning\n\nAn artificial neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of\n\nneurons\n\nin a\n\nbrain\n\n. Here, each circular node represents an\n\nartificial neuron\n\nand an arrow represents a connection from the output of one artificial neuron to the input of another.\n\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs), or\n\nconnectionist\n\nsystems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the\n\nbiological neural networks\n\nthat constitute animal\n\nbrains\n\n. Such systems \"learn\" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules.\n\nAn ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called \"\n\nartificial neurons\n\n\", which loosely model the\n\nneurons\n\nin a biological brain. Each connection, like the\n\nsynapses\n\nin a biological brain, can transmit information, a \"signal\", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a\n\nreal number\n\n, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called \"edges\". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a\n\nweight\n\nthat adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.\n\nThe original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a\n\nhuman brain\n\nwould. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from\n\nbiology\n\n. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including\n\ncomputer vision\n\n,\n\nspeech recognition\n\n,\n\nmachine translation\n\n,\n\nsocial network\n\nfiltering,\n\nplaying board and video games\n\nand\n\nmedical diagnosis\n\n.\n\nDeep learning\n\nconsists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.\n\n[\n\n86\n\n]\n\nDecision trees\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nMain article:\n\nDecision tree learning\n\nA decision tree showing survival probability of passengers on the\n\nTitanic\n\nDecision tree learning uses a\n\ndecision tree\n\nas a\n\npredictive model\n\nto go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modelling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures,\n\nleaves\n\nrepresent class labels, and branches represent\n\nconjunctions\n\nof features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically\n\nreal numbers\n\n) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and\n\ndecision making\n\n. In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision-making.\n\nRandom forest regression\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nRandom forest regression\n\n(RFR) falls under the umbrella of decision\n\ntree-based models\n\n. RFR is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and to avoid overfitting. To build decision trees, RFR uses bootstrapped sampling; for instance, each decision tree is trained on random data from the training set. This random selection of RFR for training enables the model to reduce biased predictions and achieve a higher degree of accuracy. RFR generates independent decision trees, and it can work on single-output data as well as multiple regressor tasks. This makes RFR compatible to be use in various applications.\n\n[\n\n87\n\n]\n\n[\n\n88\n\n]\n\nSupport-vector machines\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nMain article:\n\nSupport-vector machine\n\nSupport-vector machines (SVMs), also known as support-vector networks, are a set of related\n\nsupervised learning\n\nmethods used for classification and regression.

In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the\n\nkernel trick\n\n, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n\nRegression analysis\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nMain article:\n\nRegression analysis\n\nIllustration of linear regression on a data set\n\nRegression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form is\n\nlinear regression\n\n, where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as\n\nordinary least squares\n\n. The latter is often extended by\n\nregularisation\n\nmethods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in\n\nridge regression\n\n. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include\n\npolynomial regression\n\n(for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel\n\n[\n\n90\n\n]\n\n),\n\nlogistic regression\n\n(often used in\n\nstatistical classification\n\n) or even\n\nkernel regression\n\n, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the\n\nkernel trick\n\nto implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space.\n\nMultivariate linear regression\n\nextends the concept of linear regression to handle multiple dependent variables simultaneously. This approach estimates the relationships between a set of input variables and several output variables by fitting a\n\nmultidimensional\n\nlinear model. It is particularly useful in scenarios where outputs are interdependent or share underlying patterns, such as predicting multiple economic indicators or reconstructing images,\n\n[\n\n91\n\n]\n\nwhich are inherently multi-dimensional.\n\nBayesian networks\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nMain article:\n\nBayesian network\n\nA simple Bayesian network.

These methods extract patterns from data and evolve rules over time.\n\nTraining models\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nTypically, machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data to perform accurate predictions. When training a machine learning model, machine learning engineers need to target and collect a large and representative\n\nsample\n\nof data. Data from the training set can be as varied as a\n\ncorpus of text\n\n, a collection of images,\n\nsensor\n\ndata, and data collected from individual users of a service.\n\nOverfitting\n\nis something to watch out for when training a machine learning model. Trained models derived from biased or non-evaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions. Biased models may result in detrimental outcomes, thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives.\n\nAlgorithmic bias\n\nis a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training. Machine learning ethics is becoming a field of study and, notably, becoming integrated within machine learning engineering teams.\n\nFederated learning\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nMain article:\n\nFederated learning\n\nFederated learning is an adapted form of\n\ndistributed artificial intelligence\n\nto train machine learning models that decentralises the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralised server. This also increases efficiency by decentralising the training process to many devices. For example,\n\nGboard\n\nuses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to\n\nGoogle\n\n.\n\n[\n\n101\n\n]\n\nApplications\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nThere are many applications for machine learning, including:\n\nAgriculture\n\nAnatomy\n\nAdaptive website\n\nAffective computing\n\nAstronomy\n\nAutomated decision-making\n\nBanking\n\nBehaviorism\n\nBioinformatics\n\nBrain–machine interfaces\n\nCheminformatics\n\nCitizen Science\n\nClimate Science\n\nComputer networks\n\nComputer vision\n\nCredit-card fraud\n\ndetection\n\nData quality\n\nDNA sequence\n\nclassification\n\nEconomics\n\nFinancial data analysis\n\n[\n\n102\n\n]\n\nGeneral game playing\n\nHandwriting recognition\n\nHealthcare\n\nInformation retrieval\n\nInsurance\n\nInternet fraud\n\ndetection\n\nInvestment management\n\n[\n\n103\n\n]\n\nKnowledge graph embedding\n\nLinguistics\n\nMachine learning control\n\nMachine perception\n\nMachine translation\n\nMaterial Engineering\n\nMarketing\n\nMedical diagnosis\n\nNatural language processing\n\nNatural language understanding\n\nOnline advertising\n\nOptimisation\n\nRecommender systems\n\nRobot locomotion\n\nSearch engines\n\nSentiment analysis\n\nSequence mining\n\nSoftware engineering\n\nSpeech recognition\n\nStructural health monitoring\n\nSyntactic pattern recognition\n\nTelecommunications\n\nTheorem proving\n\nTime-series forecasting\n\nTomographic reconstruction\n\n[\n\n104\n\n]\n\nUser behaviour analytics\n\nIn 2006, the media-services provider\n\nNetflix\n\nheld the first \"\n\nNetflix Prize\n\n\" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%. A joint team made up of researchers from\n\nAT&T Labs\n\n-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an\n\nensemble model\n\nto win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million.\n\n[\n\n105\n\n]\n\nShortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realised that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (\"everything is a recommendation\") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.\n\n[\n\n106\n\n]\n\nIn 2010, an article in\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\n\nnoted the use of machine learning by Rebellion Research to predict the\n\n2008 financial crisis\n\n.\n\n[\n\n107\n\n]\n\nIn 2012, co-founder of\n\nSun Microsystems\n\n,\n\nVinod Khosla\n\n, predicted that 80% of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.\n\n[\n\n108\n\n]\n\nIn 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognised influences among artists.\n\n[\n\n109\n\n]\n\nIn 2019\n\nSpringer Nature\n\npublished the first research book created using machine learning.\n\n[\n\n110\n\n]\n\nIn 2020, machine learning technology was used to help make diagnoses and aid researchers in developing a cure for COVID-19.\n\n[\n\n111\n\n]\n\nMachine learning was recently applied to predict the pro-environmental behaviour of travellers.\n\n[\n\n112\n\n]\n\nRecently, machine learning technology was also applied to optimise smartphone's performance and thermal behaviour based on the user's interaction with the phone.\n\n[\n\n113\n\n]\n\n[\n\n114\n\n]\n\n[\n\n115\n\n]\n\nWhen applied correctly, machine learning algorithms (MLAs) can utilise a wide range of company characteristics to predict stock returns without\n\noverfitting\n\n.

Black box refers to a situation where the algorithm or the process of producing an output is entirely opaque, meaning that even the coders of the algorithm cannot audit the pattern that the machine extracted from the data.\n\n[\n\n127\n\n]\n\nThe House of Lords Select Committee, which claimed that such an \"intelligence system\" that could have a \"substantial impact on an individual's life\" would not be considered acceptable unless it provided \"a full and satisfactory explanation for the decisions\" it makes.\n\n[\n\n127\n\n]\n\nIn 2018, a self-driving car from\n\nUber\n\nfailed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision.\n\n[\n\n128\n\n]\n\nAttempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the\n\nIBM Watson\n\nsystem failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested.\n\n[\n\n129\n\n]\n\n[\n\n130\n\n]\n\nMicrosoft's\n\nBing Chat\n\nchatbot has been reported to produce hostile and offensive response against its users.\n\n[\n\n131\n\n]\n\nMachine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature. While it has improved with training sets, it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research itself.\n\n[\n\n132\n\n]\n\nExplainability\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nMain article:\n\nExplainable artificial intelligence\n\nExplainable AI (XAI), or Interpretable AI, or Explainable Machine Learning (XML), is artificial intelligence (AI) in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the AI.\n\n[\n\n133\n\n]\n\nIt contrasts with the \"black box\" concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision.\n\n[\n\n134\n\n]\n\nBy refining the mental models of users of AI-powered systems and dismantling their misconceptions, XAI promises to help users perform more effectively. XAI may be an implementation of the social right to explanation.\n\nOverfitting\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nMain article:\n\nOverfitting\n\nThe blue line could be an example of overfitting a linear function due to random noise.\n\nSettling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalising the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.\n\n[\n\n135\n\n]\n\nOther limitations and vulnerabilities\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nLearners can also be disappointed by \"learning the wrong lesson\". A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses.\n\n[\n\n136\n\n]\n\nA real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgments from the spatial relationship between components of the picture, and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in \"adversarial\" images that the system misclassifies.\n\n[\n\n137\n\n]\n\n[\n\n138\n\n]\n\nAdversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems or from non-pattern perturbations. For some systems, it is possible to change the output by only changing a single adversarially chosen pixel.\n\n[\n\n139\n\n]\n\nMachine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation or evasion via\n\nadversarial machine learning\n\n.\n\n[\n\n140\n\n]\n\nResearchers have demonstrated how\n\nbackdoors\n\ncan be placed undetectably into classifying (e.g., for categories \"spam\" and \"not spam\" of posts) machine learning models that are often developed or trained by third parties. Parties can change the classification of any input, including in cases for which a type of\n\ndata/software transparency\n\nis provided, possibly including\n\nwhite-box access\n\n.\n\n[\n\n141\n\n]\n\n[\n\n142\n\n]\n\n[\n\n143\n\n]\n\nModel assessments\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nClassification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the\n\nholdout\n\nmethod, which splits the data into a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the K-fold-\n\ncross-validation\n\nmethod randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods,\n\nbootstrap\n\n, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.\n\n[\n\n144\n\n]\n\nIn addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report\n\nsensitivity and specificity\n\n, meaning true positive rate (TPR) and true negative rate (TNR), respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the\n\nfalse positive rate\n\n(FPR) as well as the\n\nfalse negative rate\n\n(FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators.\n\nReceiver operating characteristic\n\n(ROC), along with the accompanying Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), offer additional tools for classification model assessment. Higher AUC is associated with a better performing model.\n\n[\n\n145\n\n]\n\nEthics\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nThis section is an excerpt from\n\nEthics of artificial intelligence\n\n.\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nThe\n\nethics\n\nof\n\nartificial intelligence\n\ncovers a broad range of topics within AI that are considered to have particular ethical stakes.\n\n[\n\n146\n\n]\n\nThis includes\n\nalgorithmic biases\n\n,\n\nfairness\n\n,\n\naccountability\n\n, transparency, privacy, and\n\nregulation\n\n, particularly where systems influence or automate human decision-making.\n\n[\n\n147\n\n]\n\nIt also covers various emerging or potential future challenges such as\n\nmachine ethics\n\n(how to make machines that behave ethically),\n\nlethal autonomous weapon systems\n\n,\n\narms race\n\ndynamics,\n\nAI safety\n\nand\n\nalignment\n\n,\n\ntechnological unemployment\n\n, AI-enabled\n\nmisinformation\n\n,\n\n[\n\n148\n\n]\n\nhow to treat certain AI systems if they have a\n\nmoral status\n\n(AI welfare and rights),\n\nartificial superintelligence\n\nand\n\nexistential risks\n\n.\n\n[\n\n146\n\n]\n\nSome application areas may also have particularly important ethical implications, like\n\nhealthcare\n\n, education, criminal justice, or the military.\n\nBias\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nMain article:\n\nAlgorithmic bias\n\nDifferent machine learning approaches can suffer from different data biases. A machine learning system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data. When trained on human-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society.\n\n[\n\n149\n\n]\n\nSystems that are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitising cultural prejudices.\n\n[\n\n150\n\n]\n\nFor example, in 1988, the UK's\n\nCommission for Racial Equality\n\nfound that\n\nSt. George's Medical School\n\nhad been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and this program had denied nearly 60 candidates who were found to either be women or have non-European-sounding names.\n\n[\n\n149\n\n]\n\nUsing job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants.\n\n[\n\n151\n\n]\n\n[\n\n152\n\n]\n\nAnother example includes predictive policing company\n\nGeolitica\n\n's predictive algorithm that resulted in \"disproportionately high levels of over-policing in low-income and minority communities\" after being trained with historical crime data.\n\n[\n\n153\n\n]\n\nWhile responsible\n\ncollection of data\n\nand documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system is considered a critical part of machine learning, some researchers blame the lack of participation and representation of minority populations in the field of AI for machine learning's vulnerability to biases.\n\n[\n\n154\n\n]\n\nIn fact, according to research carried out by the Computing Research Association in 2021, \"female faculty make up just 16.1%\" of all faculty members who focus on AI among several universities around the world.\n\n[\n\n155\n\n]\n\nFurthermore, among the group of \"new U.S. resident AI PhD graduates,\" 45% identified as white, 22.4% as Asian, 3.2% as Hispanic, and 2.4% as African American, which further demonstrates a lack of diversity in the field of AI.\n\n[\n\n155\n\n]\n\nLanguage models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases.\n\n[\n\n156\n\n]\n\n[\n\n157\n\n]\n\nBecause human languages contain biases, machines trained on language\n\ncorpora\n\nwill necessarily also learn these biases.\n\n[\n\n158\n\n]\n\n[\n\n159\n\n]\n\nIn 2016, Microsoft tested\n\nTay\n\n, a\n\nchatbot\n\nthat learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language.\n\n[\n\n160\n\n]\n\nIn an experiment carried out by\n\nProPublica\n\n, an\n\ninvestigative journalism\n\norganisation, a machine learning algorithm's insight into the recidivism rates among prisoners falsely flagged \"black defendants high risk twice as often as white defendants\".\n\n[\n\n153\n\n]\n\nIn 2015, Google Photos once tagged a couple of black people as gorillas, which caused controversy. The gorilla label was subsequently removed, and in 2023, it still cannot recognise gorillas.\n\n[\n\n161\n\n]\n\nSimilar issues with recognising non-white people have been found in many other systems.\n\n[\n\n162\n\n]\n\nBecause of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains.\n\n[\n\n163\n\n]\n\nConcern for\n\nfairness\n\nin machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good, is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including\n\nFei-Fei Li\n\n, who said that \"[t]here's nothing artificial about AI. It's inspired by people, it's created by people, and—most importantly—it impacts people. It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility.\"\n\n[\n\n164\n\n]\n\nFinancial incentives\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nThere are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines. This is especially true in the United States, where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes. There is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals with an additional tool to diagnose, medicate, and plan recovery paths for patients, but this requires these biases to be mitigated.\n\n[\n\n165\n\n]\n\nHardware\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nSince the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training\n\ndeep neural networks\n\n(a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of nonlinear hidden units.\n\n[\n\n166\n\n]\n\nBy 2019, graphics processing units (\n\nGPUs\n\n), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI.\n\n[\n\n167\n\n]\n\nOpenAI\n\nestimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from\n\nAlexNet\n\n(2012) to\n\nAlphaZero\n\n(2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.\n\n[\n\n168\n\n]\n\n[\n\n169\n\n]\n\nTensor Processing Units (TPUs)\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nTensor Processing Units (TPUs)\n\nare specialised hardware accelerators developed by\n\nGoogle\n\nspecifically for machine learning workloads. Unlike general-purpose\n\nGPUs\n\nand\n\nFPGAs\n\n, TPUs are optimised for tensor computations, making them particularly efficient for deep learning tasks such as training and inference. They are widely used in Google Cloud AI services and large-scale machine learning models like Google's DeepMind AlphaFold and large language models. TPUs leverage matrix multiplication units and high-bandwidth memory to accelerate computations while maintaining energy efficiency.\n\n[\n\n170\n\n]\n\nSince their introduction in 2016, TPUs have become a key component of AI infrastructure, especially in cloud-based environments.\n\nNeuromorphic computing\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nNeuromorphic computing\n\nrefers to a class of computing systems designed to emulate the structure and functionality of biological neural networks.

The term \"physical neural network\" highlights the use of physical hardware for computation, as opposed to software-based implementations. It broadly refers to artificial neural networks that use materials with adjustable resistance to replicate neural synapses.\n\n[\n\n172\n\n]\n\n[\n\n173\n\n]\n\nEmbedded machine learning\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nEmbedded machine learning is a sub-field of machine learning where models are deployed on\n\nembedded systems\n\nwith limited computing resources, such as\n\nwearable computers\n\n,\n\nedge devices\n\nand\n\nmicrocontrollers\n\n.\n\n[\n\n174\n\n]\n\n[\n\n175\n\n]\n\n[\n\n176\n\n]\n\n[\n\n177\n\n]\n\nRunning models directly on these devices eliminates the need to transfer and store data on cloud servers for further processing, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches, privacy leaks and theft of intellectual property, personal data and business secrets.
